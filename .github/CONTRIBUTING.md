## Contributing

**The issue page is only for bug reports. For questions, suggestions or support, join [this Discord server](https://ijskoud.dev/discord) and DM ijsKoud#7621 for help.**

When you open an issue for bug reports we expect you to provide useful information such as:

-   What is the issue and where did you find it?
-   How many times did you encounter this problem?
-   How do we reproduce this problem?
-   Is there a specific client/browser that gives the problem?
-   Is there anything unusual in the console? (Please provide a screenshot)

We do **not** accept issues with text among the lines: "Oh, this, this and that did not work. I try it everytime, even reloaded the page and its still not working"!

## Setup

To work on the project you must do the following:

**1**. Fork and clone the repository, make sure you are in the correct branch in this case the **main** branch.

**2**. Install Yarn (we do not accept npm/pnpm package manager usage here), after that run `yarn install` to install all the dependencies.

**3**. Do whatever you want to do (add things, change things, fixed things, etc)

**4**. Use `yarn run build` to build the app and `yarn run start` to start it. `yarn run dev` is usefull if you want to get up-to-date data`.

**4**. Open a [pull request](/compare) and wait for someone to review it (remember to always use semantic commit names for a PR and preferably for commits too!).
